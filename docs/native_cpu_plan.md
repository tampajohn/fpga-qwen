# Native CPU engine direction

The user-approved CPU-ENGINE-BRIEF.md supersedes the simulator optimization
plan. Target: Qwen3-0.6B on this Apple M5 Max, CPU-only, initially in the 16-bit
weight class against a tuned llama.cpp FP16 baseline. Primary metric is
single-stream decode; first-token latency at 452 prompt tokens is secondary.

`rtl/`, `sim/`, and the patched Verilator checkouts are frozen except for bug
fixes. Existing experimental code and artifacts are preserved; no pending
simulator experiment is a new release. Native implementation will live in
`engine/`, with existing tools, quality gates, server and browser reused.

## Phase 0

Keep llama.cpp source pinned to the clean local commit cb44fdb while comparing
build options, then tune decode and prefill thread counts separately. Build
candidates in `build/native-phase0/`; do not overwrite the live native build.
KleidiAI/LTO availability is not proof that a faster kernel ran. Check actual
runtime dispatch and model-buffer logs, alongside CPU-only build/runtime flags.

Use exploratory sweeps to select finalists, then at least ten alternating
paired measurements for performance claims. Save exact prompt/output token IDs,
respect EOS, disable prompt cache and speculation, and keep model loading and
warmup outside request timing. Measure 85- and 452-token prompts; report both
rather than selecting a winning context after the fact. The existing fixed
32-token workload remains a comparable starting point; longer sustained decode
can supplement it. Background OS activity remains a limitation and is recorded.

Profile separately from scoring. Sample stacks in the exact tuned binary; do
not equate worker CPU samples with critical-path wall time. Vocabulary and layer
projections can share symbols, so any callback-based attribution must report
its synchronization perturbation relative to callback-off execution.

## Phase 1 decision

John delegated remaining decisions with “use best judgement.” The working
budget is four hours of wall-clock implementation and evaluation, starting
when Phase 1 begins after Phase 0 establishes the target. Record the actual
start/deadline at that point. Apply the brief's stop rule: if the correct plain
engine is below 90% of tuned FP16 decode at expiry, stop and report the gap.
No Phase 1 implementation has started. Existing auto-push behavior continues.

Use an explicit numerical contract covering weights, activations, accumulation,
normalization and KV. BF16 and FP16 are not numerically interchangeable. Retain
token-identity gates and predeclared full-logit tolerances; diagnostic dense
logits remain available even if later vocabulary pruning is investigated.
A candidate-set optimization requires certified exclusion bounds and fallback,
not only successful recall on a finite corpus.

The worktree/branch inventory is in the local
`build/cpu-engine-worktree-inventory.txt`: 68 worktrees, 70 codex branches,
65 not ancestry-merged into main at the direction change. Cherry-picked work
may already be on main. Nothing was deleted.

## Initial baseline discovery

All four KleidiAI/LTO combinations compiled from the same clean cb44fdb source
with native CPU flags, Accelerate, OpenMP explicitly off, and GPU backends off.
Their build manifests are archived under `reports/native-phase0-*-build.json`.
The first FP16 build sweep completed two exploratory alternating rounds at
8 decode / 12 prefill threads; all configurations matched greedy IDs on the
85/452-token prompts and processed uncached prompts.

The [discovery report](../reports/native-phase0-f16-build-discovery.json) shows
no established universal winner: the untuned build had the highest observed
short decode median, and KleidiAI+LTO the highest observed long decode median.
Two observations are insufficient for a performance claim. Thread discovery,
numerical checks, profiling and ten-pair confirmation remain pending.
